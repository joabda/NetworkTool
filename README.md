# NetworkTool
This is a simple terminal Network Tool that you can use from time to time to check up on your home network.

You have a windows file with .cpp and headers + executable on windows.
You also have a linux version (developped on Centos && Fedora): Which contains a Makefile.

Feel free to leave any comment.
Thank you.
